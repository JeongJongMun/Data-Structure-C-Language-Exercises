Exercises of Data Structure using C Language. I will upload the contents recently.

**70** questions about C language Programming, **30** questions about Linked List/Stack n Queue/Binary Tree/Binary Search Tree. You will also learn C programming during these exercises. Some functions like *POP/PUSH/DEQUEUE/ENQUEUE* have been set for you in advance.

The questions are picked from **Nanyang Technological University's Online Programming System**. The answers here are written by me which may **NOT** be the same as the university's answer. Please feel free to report any bugs that you find in my codes or questions. I will fix them as soon as possible.
